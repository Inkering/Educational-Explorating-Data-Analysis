# Exploratory Data Analysis on Educational Data systems
There are two datasets explored in this repository.

## NAEP Dataset Exploration
US_Education.ipynb is a colab notebook including an exploration by Case Zito. Pictures of plots are in the NAEP_math_score_plots folder.

See here for a direct link to the notebook <https://github.com/Inkering/Educational-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/US_Education.ipynb>

## CDRC Dataset 
All the other files in the respository are an exploration done together by Annie Kroo and Dieter Brehem.

The final commented & compiled analysis and exploration is in this notebook:  
[Regression Analysis](https://github.com/Inkering/Educational-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Regression-dieter.ipynb)  

We performed a large amount of data wrangling and analysis in a few different notebooks. The process documents for this project are prominently inside these notebooks:
