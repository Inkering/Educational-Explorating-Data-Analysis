# Exploratory Data Analysis on Educational Data systems
There are two datasets explored in this repository.

## NAEP Dataset Exploration
US_Education.ipynb is a colab notebook including an exploration by Riley Zito. Pictures of plots are in the NAEP_math_score_plots folder.

See here for a direct link to the notebook [US Education Analysis Notebook](https://github.com/Inkering/Educational-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/US_Education.ipynb)

## CDRC Dataset 
All the other files in the respository are an exploration done together by Annie Kroo and Dieter Brehem.

The final commented & compiled analysis and exploration is in this notebook:  
[Regression Analysis](https://github.com/Inkering/Educational-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Regression-final.ipynb)  

A prior version of the regression notebook with more exploration and plots which is less concise
[Regression Analysis](https://github.com/Inkering/Educational-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Regression-archive.ipynb)  

We performed a large amount of data wrangling and analysis in a few different notebooks. The process documents for this project are prominently inside these notebooks:
  
* [Data Exploration with distribution exploration](https://github.com/Inkering/Educational-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Preliminary%20Exploration-archive_1.ipynb)
  
* [Older Data Exploration including school lookup tool](https://github.com/Inkering/Educational-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Preliminary%20Exploration-archive_2.ipynb)

* [Most recent Data Exploration](https://github.com/Inkering/Educational-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Preliminary%20Exploration-archive_3.ipynb)
